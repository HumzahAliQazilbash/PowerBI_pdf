## Problem Statement

As someone looking for a role in the data analyst/data scientist space, I wanted to build a dashboard that would help me choose a career path.  Using survey data from 630 participants from around the world I created the following report.

### Which role is the most popular and who is doing it?

Over 60% of survey takers described themselves as data analysts compared to only 4% who are data scientists.  Around 30% of participants were students or other.

Data analyst is by far the most popular answer and this isn't surprising as the role encompasses a broad range of tasks.  What was surprising was that the average age of data analysts sat at around 30, the same as data scientists.  I would have expected data analysts to be more junior as data analyst is usually an entry level role.  This indicates that the target audience for this survey may skewed towards people who are around 30 years old.

### Which programming language is your favourite?

Almost two-thirds of participants chose python as their favourite programming language.  R came in second place making up 16% of the vote closely followed by Other.  This tells us that the overwhelming majority of people prefer to use Python.

The question posed to survey takers was which programming language do you prefer however this doesn't tell us which language is most in demand.  I think a more practical question would be 'which language do you use the most in your job?'.  For example, alot of data analyst roles require SQL and would require applicants to have experience with the language.  Phrasing the question like this would tell me which language is required for each role.

### Salary satisfaction and Work life Balance

Work life balance was consistent across all roles, with most people rating their job a 6/10 on a scale of bad to good.       
Salary satisfaction had a bit more variation.  On average data analysts scored their salary a 4.5/10 in comparison to 5.7/10 for data scientists. Data scientists in general seem more satisfied with their salary except in UK where data scientists earned less than the average analyst.
